# StockPredictor

Built a Linear Regression Model with SKLearn to load and analyze Stock Price data in order to predict stock prices 730 days in the future from 2018! I had to use a 2018 open source stock data from Quandl because current data costs money. In the repo code, I used amazon stock as an example.
